 <h2>Bios and abstracts</h2>
 <h3 id="atker">Shohana Atker</h3>
 <h4>Bio</h4>
 <p>Hello this is Shohana Akter, a first year PhD student of LIS department. I did my undergraduate and post graduate on Information Science and Library Management from University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am interested in exploring social media from the perspective of human information consumption and barriers in online platforms. As I have started my PhD this fall I am looking forward to be a part of LIS IUB community and learn from all of this beautiful minds. I love to read fiction (though it is hard to manage time to read now) and watching TV series. My goal is to finish my PhD in four years (finger crossed). For this forum I will be presenting on an ongoing research project Dr. Pnina  Fichman and I are working on (online political trolling).</p>
<h3 id="dedema">Meredith Dedema</h3>
<h4>Bio</h4>
 <p>Meredith Dedema is a third-year PhD student from Department of Information and Library Science, Indiana University Bloomington. She received her Bachelor in Information Management and Information System from Peking University, China. She is a student fellow of the Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics and the Center of Computer Mediated Communication. Her research interests include Social Informatics, Gig Economy, and Algorithmic Management. She is currently working on multiple research projects and completing her coursework at IU.</p>
 <h4>Abstract</h4>
 <p>This study analyzed communication between scientists and laypeople via a social media platform, Twitter, during and about the COVID-19 pandemic. The study examines ICT use in a unique context, the global pandemic, from a social informatics perspective. The aim of this study was to understand what and how scientists, medical professionals, and public health organizations communicated with the public on social media, in order to improve online public health communication in the future. We collected Twitter data from 15 scientists and medical professionals, two pseudo-experts, and six federal government-sponsored public health organizations. Using content analysis, we investigated social media features, content features, social cues, and topics shown in the tweets from these accounts over three different periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results showed that scientists and medical professionals, pseudo-experts, and public health organizations used different social media features and shared different content when communicating with the public about COVID-19 and other scientific topics. In addition, different content appeared in the tweets over the three different periods. By examining the engagement level and content of tweets, we found that tweets with certain social media features and social cues received a higher count of favorites and retweets. The study informs the use of Twitter for online public engagement with science by applying a social informatics perspective. Moreover, the study contributes to the body of social informatics research by studying a sociotechnical system outside of organizational contexts.</p>
<h3 id="vladoiu">Megan Vladoiu</h3>
<h4>Bio</h4>
 <p>Megan is a 2nd year PhD student in Information Science. She received her MLS at Indiana University in 2021. Her research interests include library services, cultural heritage, and cross-cultural issues issues in libraries.</p>
<h3 id="wang">Haining Wang</h3>
<h4>Bio</h4>
 <p>Hi, it's Haining (he/him/his), a fourth-year doctoral student in the Department of Information & Library Science at Indiana University Bloomington. I'm under the supervision of Dr. Allen Riddell (chair), Dr. Xiaozhong Liu, and Dr. Staša Milojević (minor, Data Science). I focus on creating responsible AI to help people better preserve their privacy when communicating with natural language. We hope such AI can encourage free speech.</p>
 <h4>Abstract</h4>
 <p>Previous work has shown that author identity can be easily fingerprinted via stylometric analysis, e.g., authorship attribution. As a counterweight, we consider the task of target style transfer as a defense. Specifically, we propose to paraphrase the text of interest with idiosyncratic style found in over thirty English versions of the Bible. Our model shows promising performance in subverting standard authorship attribution models' decision on a standard testbed. The rephrased text is fluent and retains its original semantics well.</p>
<h3 id="wingate">Alex Wingate</h3>
<h4>Bio</h4>
 <p>Alex Wingate is a PhD student in Information Science at Indiana University Bloomington. She holds a Masters of Library Science from Indiana University and an MA in the History of the Book from the University of London. Her research focuses on booksellers in early modern Navarre, Spain and the intersection between book history and information science. She is also the Bibliography Editor for both the Chymistry of Isaac Newton Project and SHARP News.</p>
 <h4>Abstract</h4>
 <p>Inventories are some of the most important sources for book history, but the data found in inventories of early modern private libraries, booksellers, and printers are usually published as simple transcriptions of the documents—sometimes with metadata identifying the book described in each entry—in print or in online journals as PDFs by book historians. Whether in print or in PDF, this static presentation of inventory data makes it more difficult for book historians to browse, search, aggregate, and build upon each other’s data. The use of databases, especially the open-source database builder Heurist where templates increase the potential for interoperability, is an obvious choice for solving this problem and pushing book history forward. 
This presentation will discuss the ongoing development of my Heurist database Libros en Navarra | Books in Navarre (LN|BN), in which I am representing inventories of private libraries and booksellers in 16th-and 17th-century Navarre to document what books were present in Navarre in that period and to address the shortcomings of traditionally published inventory data. The LN|BN currently comprises inventories from my undergraduate and master’s theses and will be expanded upon as part of my PhD research and post-PhD. I will talk about how databases can help inventory-based book historical work; my requirements in designing the database; and how LN|BN’s structure and entities map inventories and bibliographic metadata. I will also talk about database issues that I am still working on and my goal of combining the Heurist database with a TEI digital edition of the inventories and other documents. </p>
